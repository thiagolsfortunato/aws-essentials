lifecycle
    : To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, 
    configure their lifecycle. A lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions 
    that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects.

    - Transition actions:
        : Define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might choose to 
        transition objects to the STANDARD_IA storage class 30 days after you created them, or archive objects 
        to the GLACIER storage class one year after creating them. 

    - Expiration actions:
        : Define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.
