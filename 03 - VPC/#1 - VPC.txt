VPC - Virtual Private Cloud
    :Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources 
    into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network 
    that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS. 

    - Global Infrasctructure
        - Regions:
            : Grouping of resources locate in specific location
            
            - Designed to services AWS customers (or your users) that are located closest to a Regions
            - Regions are comprised of many Avaliability Zones (AZ)
        
        - Avaliability Zones:
            : Geographical isolated zones whitin a region that house AWS resources
            
            - Separete physical Data Centers are located
            - Multiple AZ in each Region, provides redundance for resources in region.

    - IGW - Internet Gateway
        : A cominate of hardware and software that provides your private network with a route to the internet.

        - Only one IGW can be attached to VPC
        - IGW can't detatched from VPC while there are active AWS resources in the VPC (RDS, EC2, S3)

    - RT - Route Tables: 172.15.X.X/XX
        : Contains routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

        - Can have multiple active RT in a VPC
        - Can't delete RT if it has dependencies (subnets)

    - NACL - Network Access Control List
        : Optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more 
        subnets

        - Rules are evaluated lowest to highest based on rule #
        - For default Inbout/Outbound ALL traffic are ALLOWED.
        - New NACL Inbout/Outbound ALL traffic are DENIED.
        - A subnets can only be associate with ONE NACL as a time.

    - Subnets: 172.15.30.X/XX, 172.15.35.X/XX
        : Sub-section of network. Includes all the computers in a specific location.

        - Each Subnet must be reside in one AZ
        - Subnet must be associate with a RT
        - Public Subnets does have access to internet
        - Private Subnets doesn't have access to internet
        - Default VPC already has a subnets created by default.

    - AZ - Avaliability Zones 
        : Amazon EC2 is hosted in multiple locations world-wide. These locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. 
        Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. 
        Amazon EC2 provides you the ability to place resources, such as instances, and data in multiple locations. Resources 
        aren't replicated across regions unless you do so specifically.
